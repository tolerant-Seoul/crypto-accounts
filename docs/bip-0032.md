# BIP-32: Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets

BIP-32 is the specification for hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets. It defines a method for creating a tree of keys from a single seed.

## Key Features

*   **Hierarchical Structure**: Keys are organized in a tree-like structure, where a parent key can derive a sequence of child keys, and each of those can derive their own children, and so on.
*   **Deterministic Generation**: All keys are deterministically generated from a single master seed. This means that if you have the seed, you can regenerate all the keys in the wallet. This makes backing up and restoring wallets much easier and more reliable.
*   **Extended Keys**: BIP-32 introduces the concept of "extended keys". An extended key is a combination of a private or public key and a "chain code". The chain code is extra entropy that is used in the derivation of child keys.
*   **Hardened vs. Unhardened Derivation**: There are two methods for deriving child keys:
    *   **Unhardened derivation**: This method allows for the derivation of child public keys from a parent public key. This is useful for creating "watch-only" wallets that can see the balance of a wallet but cannot spend the funds.
    *   **Hardened derivation**: This method creates a "firewall" between the parent key and the child key. If a child private key derived through hardened derivation is compromised, the parent key is not at risk.

## Derivation Paths

A "derivation path" is used to specify a specific key in the tree. The path is a sequence of numbers, where each number represents the index of the child key to derive. For example, the path `m/0/1` refers to the second grandchild of the master key.

BIP-32 is a foundational standard for modern cryptocurrency wallets and is used in conjunction with other BIPs like BIP-39 (mnemonic phrases) and BIP-44 (multi-account hierarchy for deterministic wallets).
