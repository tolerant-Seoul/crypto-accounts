# BIP-43: Purpose Field for Deterministic Wallets

BIP-43 is a specification that builds on top of BIP-32 to provide a structure for deterministic wallets. It introduces the concept of a "purpose" field in the derivation path, which allows for different wallet structures to coexist.

## The `purpose` Field

BIP-43 proposes that the first level of the BIP-32 derivation path should be a "purpose" field. This field is a constant that identifies the structure of the rest of the derivation path.

The purpose field allows for different wallet standards to be developed without conflicting with each other. For example, BIP-44, which defines a multi-account hierarchy for deterministic wallets, uses a purpose field of `44'`.

## Derivation Path

The derivation path for a BIP-43 compliant wallet is as follows:

```
m / purpose' / ...
```

*   `m`: Master key
*   `purpose'`: The purpose field (hardened)

This simple addition to the derivation path provides a powerful way to organize and manage different types of wallets.
