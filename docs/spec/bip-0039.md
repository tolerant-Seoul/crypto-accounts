# BIP-39: Mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys

BIP-39 describes the implementation of a mnemonic code or mnemonic sentence -- a group of easy to remember words -- for the generation of deterministic wallets. It is a standard that is used in many popular cryptocurrency wallets.

## How it works

The process of generating a mnemonic sentence and the resulting seed is as follows:

1.  **Entropy**: A random number with a length of 128 to 256 bits is generated.
2.  **Checksum**: The first few bits of the SHA256 hash of the entropy are taken as a checksum.
3.  **Combine**: The checksum is appended to the end of the initial entropy.
4.  **Word Mapping**: The combined value is split into groups of 11 bits, and each group is mapped to a word from a predefined dictionary of 2048 words.
5.  **Mnemonic Phrase**: The resulting sequence of words is the mnemonic phrase. The number of words can be 12, 15, 18, 21, or 24.
6.  **Seed Generation**: The mnemonic phrase is then used as input to the PBKDF2 function, which generates a 512-bit seed. This seed can then be used to generate a master private key for a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet.

## Optional Passphrase

BIP-39 also allows for the use of an optional passphrase to further protect the seed. If a passphrase is used, the PBKDF2 function takes both the mnemonic and the passphrase as input. This provides an additional layer of security, as an attacker would need to know both the mnemonic and the passphrase to compromise the wallet.
