# BIP-44: Multi-Account Hierarchy for Deterministic Wallets

BIP-44 is a standard that defines a specific hierarchy for deterministic wallets. It builds upon BIP-32 and BIP-43 to create a standardized way of organizing keys for multiple cryptocurrencies and accounts.

## Derivation Path

The BIP-44 derivation path is as follows:

```
m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index
```

*   `m`: Master key
*   `purpose'`: Always `44'` for BIP-44.
*   `coin_type'`: Specifies the cryptocurrency. For example, `0'` for Bitcoin, `60'` for Ethereum.
*   `account'`: Allows for multiple accounts within a wallet.
*   `change`: Used to differentiate between external (receiving) addresses and internal (change) addresses.
*   `address_index`: The index of the address being generated.

## Benefits of BIP-44

*   **Interoperability**: By using a standardized hierarchy, different wallets can support the same set of accounts and addresses from a single seed.
*   **Organization**: It provides a clear and organized way to manage multiple cryptocurrencies and accounts.
*   **Simplicity**: Users only need to back up a single seed to restore all of their accounts and assets.

BIP-44 is widely adopted and is supported by most modern cryptocurrency wallets. It provides a robust and flexible framework for managing crypto assets.
